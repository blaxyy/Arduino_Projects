# Arduino_Projects

*Hello and welcome!*

This page is entirely dedicated to my projects which I work on in school with my Arduino. Normally I upload my code here so i can save/use it online, but i also upload it so it's free to use for everyone and for learning purposes.

This is just the beginning and eventually this repository will grow, so stay tuned.

You can aswell check my other repositories/projects.
